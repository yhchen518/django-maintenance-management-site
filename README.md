<h1>Maintenance Management Site</h1>
<p>
  This is a Django project that helped the maintenance department execute tasks.
  The website provided the abilities to access all the spare inventory parts, electrical schematics, and user manuals under the company.
  Each of them comes with a QR code that links to the specific item. The QR codes were printed out on production equipment to ease the effort on maintenance tasks.
